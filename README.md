This extension simply reads data from items on myfigurecollection.net and exports it as JSON.

Intended use is for https://github.com/ueatmybrain/figure-search

# How to use:

1. Just install the extension (idk how to sign it for firefox, will work on that later)
2. Press the "Copy JSON" button, now you have the stringified JSON object in in your clipboard.

# Compatibility

Written for Firefox but also works with Chrome/Chromium.
